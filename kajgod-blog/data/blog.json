      "hype": "<p>Starting a blog on GitHub Pages sounded like a good idea. Doing it in SSG-ed Next.js even better. What could possibly go WTF?</p>",
      "content": "<p>I never tried GitHub Pages before, but I figured if I was going to write a blog about my experiences with technology and CS, it would have a <em>clean code</em> feel to it if I encapsulated the thoughts and ideas with related code.</p><p>Being an amateur artist in spare time, I decided I should have two completely separate blogs for documenting two completely separate domains, but again - the second blog should also encapsulate \"art\" with thoughts about art.</p><p>On a more-or-less unrelated note: I wanted to make both very easy to add to. I'm planning to make an offline CMS for it which would create the content and commit it to appropriate repo. To lessen the code-writing I have to do (albeit complicate the process a bit) I decided to parse JSONs created in the CMS with Next.js. Now, Next is something I know quite well. The thought of trying something more egzotic and hip like Qwik, Fresh or Astro certainly crossed my mind, but I wanted this thing live as soon as possible, so...</p><p>All of this led to the first WTF moment on GitHub Pages.</p><h3>WTF, GitHub?</h3><p>I followed the simplest flow to getting a GitHub Page: create a repo named {yourName}.github.io and place static HTML in the root. To do so I could have changed a Next config, but I wanted to keep Next separated from the generated page in a separate folder, so I rather just added a copy action to build scrip like so:</p><pre>next build && next export && cp -r out/* ../</pre><p>Well, it didn't work. At all.</p><p>Since I couldn't figure out what seems to be the matter, I handcrafted a simple HTML page and put it in the root. That was fine, but when I tried to serve Next code again: nothing. Now, Next creates a folder _next where it serves JS and such. Nothing from that directory gets served on GitHub Pages! Hmmmm... Could it be that Pages only serves files that are in the root? You cannot use any folders? Starting to get irate, and looking into Vercel hosting and abandoning the whole <em>encapsulation</em> idea, Duck Duck Go once again came to the rescue!</p><p>Believe it or not, my dear friends, GitHub Pages considers any folder that starts with an underscore as a Jekyll folder and ignores it when serving content. WTF? I never really used Jekyll (we have some CI/CD workflow at my day job, but I never had to do much more than restart the computer running it) and it seems so random and odd to give it (and it's conventions) the first-class-citizen treament. Just let it take over all other software that uses the _{folder-name} file structure?</p><h3>All's well...</h3><p>On a positive note, the fix is quite simple:</p><pre>next build && next export && cp -r out/* ../ && touch ../.nojekyll</pre><p>...create an empty .nojekyll file in the root, and the blog page appears. Next is quite ubiquitous these days, so I guess I'm not the only one to run into this problem, and this short rant may actually prove useful to someone. You're welcome, if that happens to be you.</p>",

      "content": "<p>A bunch of artists I know are panicking that AI is going to take over their jobs. Not that they were much of a job anyway, but you work with what you have.<p><p>Anyway, AIs are doing pretty well imitating artists they get fed with, so I guess they might be right: much like stock photos practically killed once decent jobs illustrating newspaper and magazine articles (did a few gigs myself), AI seems quite capable of killing what's left in that department. No web portal ever will pay a dime to an artist from their sinking profit margins if the AI can \"draw\" an acceptable art instead. Much like they no longer pay students to argue in comments to \"increase engagement\", and soon they'll no longer pay their writers either, because AI seems to be getting better at pretending to write meaningful content also.</p><h3>But that is art?</h3><p>But what is art indeed? Creating pretty images from your editors short description is a craft for sure, but art?</p><p>There's a lot of newtalk related to creative fields introduced lately by semi-literate tech-billionaire-wannabies, so it may get confusing. But art isn't and never was nor will be content, craft or something that can be <em>stocked up</em> and served when appropriate. Come to think about it, this materialist perspective on creative products is a bit older than the internet craze... Structuralists were probably right in asserting that there is nothing <em>ontological</em> about cultural <em>texts</em> (this would include art), and it's all a product of social structures. AI is amazing at identifying those structures and generating patchworks of clich√©s and conventions it gathers from available sources</p>",
