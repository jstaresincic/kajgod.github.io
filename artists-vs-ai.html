Not that they were much of a job anyway, but you work with what you have.<p><p>Anyway, AIs are doing pretty well imitating artists they get fed with, so I guess they might be right: much like stock photos practically killed once decent jobs illustrating newspaper and magazine articles (did a few gigs myself), AI seems quite capable of killing what's left in that department. No web portal ever will pay a dime to an artist from their sinking profit margins if the AI can "draw" an acceptable art instead. Much like they no longer pay students to argue in comments to "increase engagement", and soon they'll no longer pay their writers either, because AI seems to be getting better at pretending to write meaningful content also.</p><h3>But that is art?</h3><p>But what is art indeed? Creating pretty images from your editors short description is a craft for sure, but art?</p><p>There's a lot of newtalk related to creative fields introduced lately by semi-literate tech-billionaire-wannabies, so it may get confusing. But art isn't and never was nor will be content, craft or something that can be <em>stocked up</em> and served when appropriate. Come to think about it, this materialist perspective on creative products is a bit older than the internet craze... Structuralists were probably right in asserting that there is nothing <em>ontological</em> about cultural <em>texts</em> (this would include art), and it's all a product of social structures. AI is amazing at identifying those structures and generating patchworks of clich√©s and conventions it gathers from available sources</p></div></main><footer></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"slug":"artists-vs-ai"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[slug]","query":{"slug":"artists-vs-ai"},"buildId":"I0lhv6h1M_EOKKot8nFfG","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
