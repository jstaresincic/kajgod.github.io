Not that art is much of a job anyway at this point in time, but you work with what you have.<p><p>Anyway, AIs are doing pretty well imitating artists whose <em>work</em> they get fed with, so I guess they might be right: much like stock photos practically killed a once decent job  of illustrating newspaper and magazine articles (did a few gigs myself), AI seems quite capable of killing what's left in and around that industry. No web portal will ever pay a dime to an artist from their sinking profit margins if the AI can "draw" an acceptable art instead. Much like they no longer pay students to argue in comments to "increase engagement", and soon they'll no longer pay their writers either, because AI seems to be getting better at pretending to write meaningful content also.</p><h3>But that is art?</h3><p>Now what is art in the first place? Creating pretty images from your editors' short description is a craft for sure, but art?</p><p>There's a lot of newtalk related to creative fields introduced lately by semi-literate tech-billionaire-wannabies, so it may get confusing. Art isn't, never was, nor ever will be content, craft or something that can be <em>stocked up</em> and served when appropriate. Come to think about it, this materialist perspective on creative products is a bit older than the internet craze... Structuralists were probably right in asserting that there is nothing <em>ontological</em> about cultural <em>texts</em> (this would include art), and that it's all a product of social structures. AI is amazing at identifying those structures and generating patchworks of clich√©s and conventions it gathers from available sources</p><p>What AI does not do is experience life (or art, for that matter). It isn't intrinsicly motivated to communicate it's feelings through art, and however mesmerizingly crafty it gets - it will never cut it's own ear of out of madness and inspiration. There are very few interesting directions spreading paint can take you to in the 21<sup>th</sup> century. It's all been done, right?</p><p>Art was never about giving people what they want, but making them see things only an artist seems to see. Art isn't some neural network being fed inputs, and receiving digital taps on the back when it produces something a trainer deems right accoirding to behaviour he/she wants to get out of it. AI is such a <em>good kid</p>, the one that always does as he is told and makes his folks proud. An artist is a little evli prick that gets to your nerves and will be the ruin of you, never thankful for what you do for him/her, never ever doing what is expected of him/her.</p><p>If anything, the safe, derivative craft the AI produces is anti-art.</p></div></main><footer></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"slug":"artists-vs-ai"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[slug]","query":{"slug":"artists-vs-ai"},"buildId":"3EgwfNrJVzQNGBUUdGAh5","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
